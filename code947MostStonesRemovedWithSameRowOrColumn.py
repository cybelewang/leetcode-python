"""
947 Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with another stone on the grid.

What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?

Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 1000
0 <= stones[i][j] < 10000

    """
    When we search on points,
    we alternately change our view on a row and on a col.

    We think:
    a row index, connect two stones on this row
    a col index, connect two stones on this col.

    In another viewï¼š
    A stone, connect a row index and col.

    Have this idea in mind, the solution can be much simpler.
    The number of islands of points,
    is the same as the number of islands of indexes.
