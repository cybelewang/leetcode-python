"""
You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, 
where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
Example 3:
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
Note:
The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]

"""
https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences/solution/
Call a chain a sequence of 3 or more consecutive numbers.

Considering numbers x from left to right, if x can be added to a current chain, it's at least as good to add x to that chain first, rather than to start a new chain.

Why? If we started with numbers x and greater from the beginning, the shorter chains starting from x could be concatenated with the chains ending before x, possibly helping us if there was a "chain" from x that was only length 1 or 2.
